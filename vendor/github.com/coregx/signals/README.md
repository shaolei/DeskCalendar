A modern, production-grade reactive programming library for Go 1.25+ that brings Angular's powerful signals pattern to the Go ecosystem with full type safety, zero allocations in hot paths, and comprehensive concurrency support.

---

## Features

- **Pure Go** - No dependencies, works everywhere Go works
- **Type-Safe** - Full generic support with Go 1.25+ type parameters
- **Thread-Safe** - Built-in synchronization for concurrent access
- **Zero Allocations** - Hot paths designed for zero heap allocations
- **Angular-Compatible** - API design inspired by Angular Signals
- **Fine-Grained Reactivity** - Only re-compute what changed
- **Glitch-Free** - Atomic updates prevent intermediate states
- **Lazy Evaluation** - Computed values calculate only when needed
- **Effect Batching** - Multiple updates trigger single effect execution
- **Production Ready** - 51 tests, 67.9% coverage, comprehensive benchmarks

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/coregx/signals
```

Requires Go 1.25 or later.

### Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/coregx/signals"
)

func main() {
    // Create a reactive signal
    count := signals.NewSignal(0)

    // Create computed value that auto-updates
    doubled := signals.NewComputed(func() int {
        return count.Get() * 2
    })

    // Create effect that runs when dependencies change
    signals.NewEffect(func() {
        fmt.Printf("Count: %d, Doubled: %d\n", count.Get(), doubled.Get())
    })
    // Output: Count: 0, Doubled: 0

    // Update signal - effect automatically re-runs
    count.Set(5)
    // Output: Count: 5, Doubled: 10

    count.Set(10)
    // Output: Count: 10, Doubled: 20
}
```

### Advanced Example

```go
// Multiple dependencies
firstName := signals.NewSignal("John")
lastName := signals.NewSignal("Doe")

fullName := signals.NewComputed(func() string {
    return firstName.Get() + " " + lastName.Get()
})

// Effect with cleanup
effect := signals.NewEffect(func() {
    fmt.Println("Full name:", fullName.Get())
}, signals.WithCleanup(func() {
    fmt.Println("Effect cleaned up")
}))

firstName.Set("Jane")  // Effect re-runs
lastName.Set("Smith")  // Effect re-runs

effect.Cleanup()  // Manual cleanup when done
```
