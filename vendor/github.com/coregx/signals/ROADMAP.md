# Signals Library - Development Roadmap

> **Reactive State Management for Go** - Inspired by Angular Signals
> **Approach**: Angular-compatible API with Go idioms and zero allocations

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-31
**Current Version**: v0.1.0 (Stable!)
**Strategy**: Core complete → Documentation → v1.0.0 stable
**Target**: v1.0.0 stable (2026-02-15)

## 🎯 Vision

Build a **production-ready, type-safe reactive state management library** for Go that brings the power of Angular Signals to the Go ecosystem with full type safety, thread-safety, and zero allocations in hot paths.

### Key Advantages

✅ **Angular Signals Compatible**
- Immediate effect execution (Angular pattern)
- Computed signals with memoization
- Proper cleanup sequence
- Read-only encapsulation (AsReadonly)

✅ **Go-First Design**
- Full generics support (Go 1.25+)
- context.Context integration
- Thread-safe (sync.RWMutex)
- Zero allocations in hot paths
- Panic recovery throughout

✅ **Production Ready**
- 51 tests, 68.3% coverage
- Race detector clean
- Comprehensive benchmarks
- CI/CD configured
